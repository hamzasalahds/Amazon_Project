Powerpoint for the project can be seen [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Aon19ecNhTKC0BzjHg3IYMSkk1VZ?e=qSLBuG)

During my time at Amazon Fullfillment Center in Memphis, I had the oppurtunity to work on a project that aimed to help improve employee performance, my role was to assist the operations team with the technical side of the project.

The primary objective of the project was to develop a system capable of analyzing performance to aid the OPS team in tracking and improving employee performance and productivity.

## Overview of system

- This system is an Excel workbook with integrated formulas, macros, and automation features. That refreshes on demand, providing several resources in a single location, and allowing data to be searchable.

- It helps managers make instant business decisions using a dashboard showing a variety of metrics and KPIs.

- The data generated is used to create employee performance reports.

- It is also used to identify areas for improvement, such as training, processes, and technology.


## System Creation Process
1. Identified Stakeholders:
- The Ops Team.
- Included a total of 10 people and end users.

2. Created a Statement of Requirements by summarizing user needs.

- User Interface:
- Dashboard with the ability to customize views and reports based on user roles and preferences.

## Performance Analysis:
- Automated calculations of performance metrics such as productivity, efficiency, and goal attainment.


## Reporting: 
-  The need for specific reports and dashboards to visualize performance trends and identify areas for improvement.


3. Designed the System:

- Designed the structure of the Excel system, including worksheets, and tables, 

- Design user-friendly interfaces using Excel's features such as buttons, and dropdown lists to streamline data entry and navigation.

- Used calculations, formulas, functions, and macros needed to automate processes and perform analysis within the Excel system.

4. Implementation:

- Imported Data into the system.

- Automated formulas and macros to perform calculations, and other tasks as per the defined requirements.

- Provide training documentation to familiarize users with the Excel system's features and functionalities.


## Technical Skills
- I employed a range of technical skills and tools including Microsoft Office Tools such as Excel.

- I used charts, dashboards, calculations, functions, and lookup methods. 

- I utilized resources such as Amazon’s internal wiki and learning materials to enhance my understanding and effectiveness in project development.

## Project Steps
- Identified Metrics that will be used to define the KPIs.

- Imported employee CSV data sheets, including only relevant columns.

- Cleaned the data using power query

- Created sheets that use formulas to LOOKUP imported employee data

- Developed formulas for calculations using SUMIFS, AVERAGE, COUNTS, and VLOOKUPS.

- Created a dashboard that included metrics.

### Data Collection and Preparation
- The primary data sources utilized for analysis were CSV files exported from various internal sources relevant to the scope of the project.

- In the project, I heavily relied on data importation techniques to transform and clean data within Excel using power query. 


### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- I imported the CSV files directly into Excel worksheets using the "From Text/CSV" option in the "Data" tab.

- Upon import, I carefully examined the data in power query to identify any inconsistencies, missing values, or formatting issues.

- Using power query, I performed several data cleaning tasks, like removing unnecessary columns. 

- After cleaning, I formatted data types, and standardized text fields to prepare the data for analysis.

### Some challenges with the data
- Data needed transformations to be usable in formulas.

- No Summarizations included.

- Extra Columns.


## Employee Analysis
Some of the analyses performed include:

- Headcount Trends & Forecasts

- Employee Rates

- Work Details Breakdown


## Headcount Analysis
- Performed headcount analysis and forecasts.

- Compared planned headcount with digital and actual headcounts.

- The goal was to keep operational costs low in return accomplish more with fewer resources.

- Performed forecasting in Excel using linear regression to determine hourly headcount.

## Employee Rates
- Employee Rates were tracked on an individual level and group level.

- Lookup functions were used to retrieve AA rates from imported sheets each hour.

- I implemented conditional formatting for the highest and lowest average employee rates to automatically showcase the occurrence time.

- Use a combination of IF, MIN, and MAX to generate this formula.

## Work Details
- Created a sheet that serves as a comprehensive repository of employee work details. By entering an employee ID, users gain access to the associate's work specifics, which include hourly function time and rates. The sheet dynamically retrieves data from the employee rate sheet based on the provided employee ID, leveraging VLOOKUP functionality.​

- Showcases the duration spent on different tasks such as small, medium, large, and bulky items, along with the total hours worked per hour. Additionally, it also aids in calculating time on task and time off task in minutes. ​

- A vertically stacked graph is utilized to visually represent the function time.​

## Other Metrics
- Work Piles​

​- Successful diverts and forecasts​

​- Number of errors made​

​- Safety Reports​

​- Daily Volume Percentage of Goal Achieved/Remaining​

​
## Challenges & Solutions​
- Throughout the Project, I encountered several challenges, including: ​

​- Performance Issues​

​- Complexity of some charts​

Purposed Training Initiatives​
- ​Collaborated with senior management to provide targeted training for 50 employees using a variety of formats, such as classroom training or on-the-job training.​

1- Utilized the employee system to track performance metrics such as items processed, error rates, TOT, and task completion times to identify areas to identify employees who are struggling.​

2- Conducted surveys on job satisfaction and training needs to enhance the work environment.​

3- Updated and streamlined workflows by creating documentation and problem-solving process techniques to improve work efficiency.​

​
## Impact
- The Project had a profound impact on the organization, resulting in improvements in employee performance and decision-making processes. ​

- ​Through targeted training, we achieved a 10% improvement in sorting efficiency and provided valuable insights for strategic decision-making, ultimately contributing to the organization's success and competitiveness.​

- ​Implementing targeted training initiatives alongside our Excel-based performance tracking system resulted in significant improvements in sorting efficiency and productivity in our 300+ employee department. This led to a 10% performance increase and the processing of over 262,000 items.​

## Evaluation
The system went through Iterations and Improvements that included different colors for visibility, and the addition of different metrics like safety reports.​
